# GENIUS WITHIN

This is the Genius Website project developed by Innovators for Purpose (iFp) Studios.

Co-creators: Ramzey (Github: foxwithahdie),

This repository is created using Next.js, a React.js framework. React.js is a JavaScript framework that turns parts of code into components to be used in other parts of code in the form of an HTML tag.

This repository uses ESLint, Javascript, JSX (Javascript XML), and CSS.
